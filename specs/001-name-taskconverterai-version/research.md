# Research: TaskConverterAI Service Gateway

**Purpose**: Resolve technical unknowns and establish implementation patterns
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Feature**: TaskConverterAI Service Gateway

## Technology Decisions

### Frontend Technology Stack

**Decision**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
**Rationale**: 
- Aligns with constitution requirement for simplicity (no frameworks)
- No build tools needed - files can be served directly
- Modern browser support for ES6 provides sufficient functionality
- Static delivery compatible with GitHub Pages

**Alternatives considered**: 
- React/Vue.js: Rejected due to build complexity and framework overhead
- TypeScript: Rejected to maintain simplicity and avoid build steps
- jQuery: Rejected as unnecessary abstraction for simple navigation

### Documentation Integration

**Decision**: Swagger UI via CDN integration
**Rationale**:
- No local installation or build process required
- Well-established, reliable CDN availability
- Standard OpenAPI documentation rendering
- Maintains static delivery principle

**Alternatives considered**:
- Local Swagger UI installation: Rejected due to dependency management complexity
- Custom documentation renderer: Rejected due to development overhead
- iframe embedding: Considered but CDN integration provides better control

### Service Configuration

**Decision**: Static JSON configuration embedded in JavaScript
**Rationale**:
- No external API calls required for service discovery
- Simple to maintain and update
- Fits static delivery model
- Easy to version control

**Alternatives considered**:
- External API for service discovery: Rejected as violates static delivery principle
- YAML configuration: Rejected as requires parser, JSON is native to JavaScript
- Hardcoded in HTML: Rejected due to maintainability concerns

### Deployment Strategy

**Decision**: GitHub Pages static hosting
**Rationale**:
- Zero-configuration deployment for static sites
- Automatic HTTPS and CDN distribution
- Version control integration
- No server management required

**Alternatives considered**:
- Netlify/Vercel: Rejected as GitHub Pages sufficient for requirements
- Traditional web hosting: Rejected due to unnecessary complexity
- S3 static hosting: Rejected as requires AWS account setup

## Implementation Patterns

### Service Card Rendering

**Pattern**: Template-based generation with vanilla JavaScript
**Implementation**: DOM manipulation using template strings and event delegation
**Rationale**: Simple, performant, no external dependencies

### Navigation Handling

**Pattern**: Client-side routing using hash-based navigation
**Implementation**: Window location hash changes for service page navigation
**Rationale**: Works with static hosting, no server-side routing needed

### Error Handling

**Pattern**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages
**Implementation**: Try-catch blocks with fallback content display
**Rationale**: Maintains usability when external resources unavailable

## Best Practices Applied

### Performance Optimization
- Minimize HTTP requests through CDN usage
- Optimize image assets (logo) for web delivery
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility
- Implement responsive design for cross-device compatibility

### Maintainability
- Separate concerns: HTML structure, CSS presentation, JS behavior
- Use clear naming conventions for files and functions
- Document service configuration format
- Provide example service for onboarding

### Security Considerations
- Use HTTPS CDN sources for external dependencies
- Implement Content Security Policy headers where possible
- Validate service configuration data before usage
- Sanitize dynamic content insertion

## Conclusion

All technical decisions support the constitutional principles of simplicity and static delivery. The chosen stack requires no build tools, uses minimal dependencies, and provides a clear path to deployment on GitHub Pages.
