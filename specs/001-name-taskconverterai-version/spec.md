# Feature Specification: TaskConverterAI Service Gateway

**Feature Branch**: `001-name-taskconverterai-version`  
**Created**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "name: TaskConverterAI
  version: 1.0.0
  description: >
    TaskConverterAI — это статическое веб-приложение, служащее центральной точкой
    доступа к микросервисам проекта. Главная страница отображает список сервисов в виде карточек,
    каждая из которых ведёт к странице с OpenAPI (Swagger) документацией.
  
  goals:
    - Обеспечить удобный доступ к Swagger-документации микросервисов.
    - Объединить микросервисы проекта в единый навигационный интерфейс.
    - Минимизировать зависимость от серверной логики (всё статично)."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Service Directory (Priority: P1)

A developer or system administrator needs to see all available microservices in the TaskConverterAI project from a central location. They visit the main page and see service cards displaying service names, descriptions, and status information.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that provides immediate value - users can discover and access all available services from one place. Without this, the application has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the main page and verifying that service cards are displayed with correct information, delivering the basic navigation value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the main page is loaded, **When** a user visits the application, **Then** they see a grid of service cards showing service names, descriptions, and visual indicators
2. **Given** multiple services exist, **When** the page loads, **Then** all services are displayed in an organized, scannable format
3. **Given** a service is unavailable, **When** the page loads, **Then** the service card shows appropriate status indication

### User Story 2 - Navigate to Service Documentation (Priority: P2)

A developer needs to view the OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for a specific microservice. They click on a service card and are taken to that service's documentation page or interface.

**Why this priority**: This completes the primary user journey - from discovery to documentation access. Essential for the application's stated goal of providing convenient access to Swagger documentation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking any service card and verifying navigation to the correct documentation interface.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a service card is displayed, **When** a user clicks on it, **Then** they are navigated to the service's OpenAPI documentation
2. **Given** multiple services exist, **When** a user clicks different service cards, **Then** each leads to the correct service documentation
3. **Given** a service documentation is unavailable, **When** a user clicks the card, **Then** they see an appropriate error message or fallback

### User Story 3 - Responsive Service Layout (Priority: P3)

A user accesses the service directory from different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile). The service cards adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining usability and readability.

**Why this priority**: Enhances accessibility and user experience across devices, but the core functionality works without this feature.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by resizing browser window or accessing from different devices to verify responsive behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the page is viewed on a desktop, **When** the screen size changes, **Then** service cards reflow appropriately
2. **Given** the page is accessed on mobile, **When** loaded, **Then** cards are sized and arranged for touch interaction
3. **Given** different screen orientations, **When** device is rotated, **Then** layout adapts without breaking functionality

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no services are available or the service list is empty?
- How does the system handle services with very long names or descriptions?
- What occurs when a service's documentation endpoint is unreachable?
- How does the system behave when JavaScript is disabled in the browser?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a list of microservices as interactive cards on the main page
- **FR-002**: System MUST show service name, description, and status for each service card  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to click on service cards to navigate to OpenAPI documentation
- **FR-004**: System MUST be deliverable as static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript only)
- **FR-005**: System MUST load service information from a configuration file or embedded data
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide visual feedback for service availability status
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle navigation to external documentation URLs or embedded Swagger UI
- **FR-008**: System MUST display appropriate messages when services are unavailable

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Service**: Represents a microservice with name, description, documentation URL, and status information
- **Service Card**: Visual representation of a service on the main interface
- **Service Configuration**: Static data structure containing service definitions and metadata

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can locate and access any service documentation within 10 seconds of loading the page
- **SC-002**: Page loads completely in under 3 seconds on standard web connections
- **SC-003**: 95% of service card clicks successfully navigate to documentation without errors
- **SC-004**: Interface remains functional and usable on screen sizes from 320px to 1920px width
- **SC-005**: Application works offline once initially loaded (no server dependencies for core functionality)

## Assumptions

- Service information will be maintained in a static configuration file or embedded in the application
- OpenAPI documentation is hosted separately and accessible via URLs
- Service status checking (if implemented) will be done client-side via API calls
- Users have modern web browsers with JavaScript enabled
- Documentation URLs are stable and follow standard OpenAPI/Swagger patterns
